How to Use Google Sheets for the Jeopardy Game:

1.  **Create a Google Sheet:**
    *   Go to Google Sheets (sheets.google.com) and create a new spreadsheet.

2.  **Set Up Tabs:**
    *   Rename the first sheet tab to `Questions`.
    *   Create a second sheet tab and rename it to `Answers`.

3.  **Populate the "Questions" Tab:**
    *   Use the `questions_template.csv` file as a guide.
    *   **Row 1:** Enter your category names in cells A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1.
    *   **Row 2:** Enter the $200 questions for each category in cells A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, F2.
    *   **Row 3:** Enter the $400 questions for each category in cells A3, B3, C3, D3, E3, F3.
    *   **Row 4:** Enter the $600 questions for each category in cells A4, B4, C4, D4, E4, F4.
    *   **Row 5:** Enter the $800 questions for each category in cells A5, B5, C5, D5, E5, F5.
    *   **Row 6:** Enter the $1000 questions for each category in cells A6, B6, C6, D6, E6, F6.
    *   **Important:** Ensure you have exactly 6 rows (1 for categories, 5 for questions) and 6 columns filled.

4.  **Populate the "Answers" Tab:**
    *   Use the `answers_template.csv` file as a guide.
    *   **Structure MUST match the "Questions" tab exactly.**
    *   **Row 1:** Enter the *same* category names as the Questions tab in A1:F1.
    *   **Row 2:** Enter the corresponding $200 *answers* for each category in A2:F2.
    *   **Row 3:** Enter the corresponding $400 *answers* for each category in A3:F3.
    *   **Row 4:** Enter the corresponding $600 *answers* for each category in A4:F4.
    *   **Row 5:** Enter the corresponding $800 *answers* for each category in A5:F5.
    *   **Row 6:** Enter the corresponding $1000 *answers* for each category in A6:F6.
    *   **Important:** The answer in cell B3 of the Answers tab must correspond to the question in cell B3 of the Questions tab, and so on.

5.  **Publish to Web as CSV:**
    *   **For the "Questions" tab:**
        *   Click on the "Questions" tab to make it active.
        *   Go to `File` > `Share` > `Publish to web`.
        *   In the dialog box, under "Link":
            *   Select the `Questions` sheet from the first dropdown.
            *   Select `Comma-separated values (.csv)` from the second dropdown.
        *   Click the `Publish` button. Confirm if asked.
        *   Copy the generated URL. This is your Questions CSV URL.
    *   **For the "Answers" tab:**
        *   Click on the "Answers" tab to make it active.
        *   Go to `File` > `Share` > `Publish to web`.
        *   In the dialog box, under "Link":
            *   Select the `Answers` sheet from the first dropdown.
            *   Select `Comma-separated values (.csv)` from the second dropdown.
        *   Click the `Publish` button. Confirm if asked.
        *   Copy the generated URL. This is your Answers CSV URL.
    *   **Note:** Publishing makes the data in these specific sheets publicly accessible via the URLs. Do not use sensitive information. If you make changes to the sheets, you usually *don't* need to republish; the CSV URLs should update automatically after a short delay (usually a few minutes).

6.  **Load into the Game:**
    *   Open the `jeopardy2.html` file in your browser.
    *   Paste the copied Questions CSV URL into the "Questions CSV URL" input field.
    *   Paste the copied Answers CSV URL into the "Answers CSV URL" input field.
    *   Click the "Load Game" button.

7.  **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Error Loading Data:** Double-check the URLs are correct, that both sheets are published as CSV, and that the structure (6 columns, 6 rows) exactly matches the template in both sheets. Check the browser's developer console (usually F12) for more specific error messages.
    *   **Missing Clues:** Ensure every cell from A1 to F6 has content in both the Questions and Answers sheets.
    *   **Data Not Updating:** Google Sheets caches published data. Wait 5-10 minutes after making changes for the CSV URLs to reflect the updates.
